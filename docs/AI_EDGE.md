# AI Domain Expertise Edge

## Why This Edge Exists

The prediction market participants pricing AI-related events:
- Read TechCrunch headlines
- Don't understand transformer architectures
- Can't distinguish hype from capability
- Miss second and third-order implications
- Anchor on recent demos, not fundamentals

You:
- Understand what's technically possible vs hard
- See capability trajectories before they're obvious
- Connect AI developments to economic/market effects
- Know what benchmarks actually measure
- Can estimate realistic timelines

**This is alpha.**

## Market Categories by Edge Quality

### Tier 1: AI → Economic Data (Best Edge)

Nobody is connecting AI capabilities to economic statistics. You can.

**Productivity Metrics:**
- AI coding assistants → developer output → productivity stats
- AI automation → process efficiency → manufacturing output
- AI customer service → labor reallocation → service sector metrics

**Market Examples:**
- "Will Q2 productivity growth exceed X%?"
- "Will tech sector output surprise to upside?"
- "Will unit labor costs decline?"

**Your reasoning:**
```
GitHub Copilot + Claude Code + Cursor widely deployed
  → Developer productivity up 20-30%
  → But BLS measures this with lag
  → Current productivity estimates understate reality
  → Q2 numbers will surprise to upside
```

**Labor Markets:**
- "Will tech layoffs continue?"
- "Will job openings in X sector decline?"
- "Will wage growth in Y category slow?"

**Your reasoning:**
```
AI enables 10-person team to do work of 20
  → Companies restructuring, not just cutting
  → Hiring freezes while redefining roles
  → Layoffs continue but nature changes
```

**Inflation Components:**
- "Will core services CPI decline?"
- "Will goods inflation stay negative?"

**Your reasoning:**
```
AI driving down costs of:
  → Software development (internal tools cheaper)
  → Customer service (fewer agents needed)
  → Content creation (marketing costs down)
  → These feed into specific CPI baskets
```

### Tier 2: AI → Tech Earnings (Strong Edge)

You understand real demand vs hype, infrastructure bottlenecks, timing.

**NVIDIA/Chips:**
- "Will NVDA beat earnings by X%?"
- "Will data center revenue exceed $X?"

**Your edge:** Understand actual GPU demand from:
- Training runs (who's training what, how big)
- Inference scaling (deployment patterns)
- Supply constraints (TSM capacity, CoWoS packaging)

**Cloud Providers (MSFT, GOOG, AMZN):**
- "Will Azure AI revenue grow X%?"
- "Will cloud capex increase by Y%?"

**Your edge:** Understand:
- Which AI workloads are actually running in cloud
- Enterprise adoption curves
- Margin impact of AI features

**AI-Native Companies:**
- "Will OpenAI hit revenue milestone?"
- "Will Anthropic raise at valuation X?"

**Your edge:** Understand:
- API usage patterns
- Enterprise vs consumer mix
- Real competitive dynamics vs press releases

---

### Tier 3: AI Capability Milestones (Moderate Edge)

More watched, but still mispriced on timing.

**Benchmark Markets:**
- "Will GPT-5 pass benchmark X?"
- "Will AI achieve Y capability by date Z?"

**Your edge:**
- Know what benchmarks actually measure (vs what headlines say)
- Understand capability curves and what's bottlenecked
- Can estimate realistic timelines based on technical constraints

**Product Markets:**
- "Will X company launch AI feature by date?"
- "Will autonomous Y be deployed in Z location?"

**Your edge:**
- Understand technical readiness vs announcement timing
- Know regulatory/safety gates
- See integration complexity others underestimate

---

### Tier 4: AI Regulatory/Policy (Good Edge)

**Your edge:** Understand what's technically feasible to regulate.

**Examples:**
- "Will EU AI Act provision X be enforced by date?"
- "Will compute threshold Y be implemented?"
- "Will export controls on Z chips tighten?"

**Reasoning approach:**
```
Regulation requires:
  1. Technical definition (what exactly are we regulating?)
  2. Measurement capability (how do we verify compliance?)
  3. Enforcement mechanism (how do we catch violators?)

If any of these is technically infeasible → deadline slips
Most regulators don't understand the technical constraints
```

## Reasoning Framework for AI Markets

### Step 1: Technical Reality Check

Ask yourself:
- What's the actual state of this capability right now?
- What are the bottlenecks (compute, data, algorithms, safety)?
- What's the realistic timeline based on current trajectory?
- Is the market pricing hype or fundamentals?

### Step 2: Implication Mapping

Trace the causal chains:
```
AI capability X exists
  → Enables application Y
  → Affects industry Z
  → Shows up in metric W
  → Market for W is mispriced
```

The further down this chain, the better your edge (fewer people see it).

### Step 3: Market Narrative Analysis

- What does the average Kalshi bettor think about this?
- What headline are they anchoring on?
- What technical nuance are they missing?
- Where is sentiment diverging from reality?

### Step 4: Timeline Arbitrage

AI markets are often mispriced on WHEN, not IF.

- Market thinks: "AGI soon!" → Actually: slower than hype
- Market thinks: "AI just a chatbot" → Actually: already transforming workflows

Look for timeline mispricings where your technical knowledge gives you better estimates.

## Anti-Patterns: Where AI Edge Doesn't Help

- Pure capability timing bets with high variance (model release dates)
- Consumer AI adoption rates (driven by marketing, not tech)
- AI company valuations (driven by VC sentiment, not fundamentals)
- AI doomer/optimist debates (philosophical, not tradeable)

---

## Example Analysis: NVDA Earnings

**Market:** Will NVDA data center revenue exceed $X billion?

**Headlines-based view:** "AI demand is huge, will beat"

**Your first-principles view:**
```
Training demand:
  - Major labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta) training schedules
  - Estimate compute requirements for known projects
  - Supply constraints (how many H100s actually shipped?)

Inference demand:
  - API call volumes (estimate from public data)
  - Enterprise deployment timelines
  - Cost optimization (are customers getting efficient?)

Supply constraints:
  - TSM CoWoS packaging capacity
  - Memory bandwidth bottlenecks
  - Lead times on orders

Synthesis:
  - Demand > Supply still true?
  - Growth rate sustainable?
  - Market expectations realistic?
```

**Your estimate:** Based on bottleneck analysis, growth will be X% not Y%

**Edge:** Understanding supply chain constraints others miss
